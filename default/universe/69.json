The Marauders and Wardens continue their ancestors' legacy of war and animosity, despite how removed they are from those initial conflicts.",

      "description": "A horde of nomadic warriors with a taste for brutality, the Marauders are all that remain of Magelord warrior culture, their ancient traditions abandoned in favor of anarchic shows of force. No dispute is settled until blood is spilled, even within their own ranks. They lost sight of what led their ancestors to war in the first place and what ultimately led to their victory."

Though the order itself was disbanded long ago, Wardens now don their armor as they lie in wait for the opportunity to strike against the descendants of their ancient enemy."
