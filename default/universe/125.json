  "description": "Long ago, in a time beyond all living memory, the existence of magic was swept away from the universe. Life moved on, but some worlds could not, and as years turned to decades and centuries, nature began to rebalance itself. Finally the time has come, and now magic is ready to make its return, though not in the form that anyone expects.",

      "description": "When the Prismae appeared, there were those that learned to hone their magic. But far to the north, the crystals' influence corrupts the very earth itself. Between the fractal undergrowth and iridescent air, creatures join forces with once-human inhabitants in a war against what remains of civilization. Everything will be reflected in the Prismae's image."

      "description": "Motus was a world bound to magic, but after the purge, everything collapsed. Centuries later, civilization is scattered, nature has reclaimed the cities, and magic's back in the form of Prismae Crystals. All it wants is to spread, and while some can use its power safely, others lose themselves to its pull and are taken over. So begins the Prismae Wars."
