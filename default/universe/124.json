Any who resist are brought to heel or eliminated… but an Uprising is coming. Armed with dangerous magic inked directly into their skin, these rebels seek to topple the Cabal and give the city back to its people—or die trying.",

      "description": "On the outskirts of Rabadon City, a dilapidated temple houses the last hope for Rabadon's people: the Inkshadow Warriors. Each one sacrifices what is most important to them in order to make a contract with ancient spirits, who imbue them with magic tattoos so powerful, even the Cabal trembles. They are victims no more. It is time to take back their home."
