      "description": "Each year, a mischievous Lunar Beast arrives in the mortal realm, drawn to the New Year's celebrations. And each year, the corresponding Lunar God selects a squad of chosen champions to lead the beast on a merry chase and protect the city from the creature's playful rampage. The Lunar Parade is a beloved part of the New Year's festivities and the Beast itself brings good luck once it's been lulled to rest by the squad's efforts. When a Lunar Beast is well-entertained and well-rested, it always signals a prosperous New Year!"
