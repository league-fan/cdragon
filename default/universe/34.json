She devoured the sun itself and, descending from that empty heaven, inspired her knights to decimate all those that remained. Centuries later, they stand, the only hope against the rising Coven's darkness.",

      "description": "The witches lay in wait, a sisterhood of frightening pulchritude, their hopes whispered forth from desacralized lips. They speak of the bloating corpses of Old Gods, of ancient rites carried out with magics long forgotten to mortal mind, of the return of what they call \"order\", but others call \"suffering\". Hark! Mankind's end fast approaches."

      "description": "The sylvan creatures of the northern forests lie dormant, unseen by weary traveler and brave warrior alike. These foul things wait for the perfect moment to strike, an exercise in patience passed only by creatures as ancient as the land itself, the prize a feast of flesh and bone that bathes the soil in dark, rich crimson."

However, as horrors of the outside world spread, the defenders struggle to maintain their strongholds against humanity's malicious curiosity."

      "description": "This story of a cursed queen and the wretched followers of her order makes unpleasant bedside banter for parents and their children. But lessons last longer when the tale is gripped in shadow, which swirls in dreams and shapes the souls of impressionable youth. The nightmares are just nightmares, after all... or so the adults pray."
