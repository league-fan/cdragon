      "description": "The Harrowing spreads its Black Mist across Runeterra, corrupting indiscriminately. Some, in its presence, are swayed to follow the Ruined King, believing their goals aligned. But Viego wants only the return of Isolde; he has no allies. The Ruined who aid him in halting the Sentinels are mere pawns in a broken-hearted lover's game."

For years they've fought back the Harrowing, aided by ancient relic-stone weaponry that channels their very souls into a powerful light. But all that matters now is the battle ahead, as the Ruined King lays waste to Runeterra, all to dance with his queen once more."
