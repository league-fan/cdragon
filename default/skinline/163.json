  "description": "Udyr spent almost a decade training in Ionia with the monks of the Hirana Monastery, learning to control and master his spiritual abilities. At last, when the Freljord called him home, he chose to stay and complete his training. In the time since then, Udyr has become part of the Ionian landscape, both spiritual and mortal, as he works with Lee Sin and Karma to return balance to the wartorn land.",
