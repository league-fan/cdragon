  "description": "In a fighters' colosseum, Jax's victories were celebrated by a young kid and dedicated fan, Joe. Jax found that Joe himself was an incredible warrior, far braver than anyone Jax had met. Joe gave Jax the nickname “Jaximus,” a title he heartily accepted. “Here's to you, kid,” declared Jax as he charged into battle, hoisting the lamplight in Joe's honor."
