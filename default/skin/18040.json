  "description": "Hex-powered munitions have been around since the early days of hextech innovation, but no one has perfected their use like Tristana. Decorated for her service in protecting the innocent with her Hexcrystal Cannon (Mark III), she stands at the forefront of martial hextechnology as a staunch and noble advocate."
