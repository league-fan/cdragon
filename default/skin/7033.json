  "description": "Resurrected by the Black Crane, LeBlanc has rejoined her sisters with renewed purposeâ€”yet the gifts of the Old Gods do not come without a price. As her body twists into new and strange forms, LeBlanc has discovered that she is the vessel through which her own dead god will return, and that it has granted her impossible power."
