  "description": "A boy genius from the rough streets, Ekko turned to music as a way to express himself. His prodigious lyricism and technological savvy could have bought him a way out, but instead, he chose to stay and uplift his neighborhood. Now, he fiercely resists the temptations of fame and glory, garnering a following among the young and hopeful who see him as an avatar for their own potential."
