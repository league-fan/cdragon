  "description": "In an age before man, King Voli ruled the bitter northlands, and he was as harsh and unforgiving as they were. It is said that he waged a terrible war against his brother, the great King Ornn, and that their struggle razed mountains and emptied seas, as the two of them became like beasts themselves."
