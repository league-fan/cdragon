  "description": "On a cliff overlooking the sea, the lonely gorgon Cassiopeia has made her home among a garden of statues of her own making. Memories of friends, enemies, and lovers passed, immortalized in stone, many eternally screaming in agony. Whispers from the local villages warn not to enter her domain, but still, visitors keep coming, all to meet the same fate.",
