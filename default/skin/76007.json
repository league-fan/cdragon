  "description": "Of the legends surrounding Nidalee, it is difficult to know what is true and what is mere myth. Some within the Warring Kingdoms say she fights with the wild ferocity of a white tiger, that the tiger's spirit dwells within her heart. Others believe she is the white tiger, that she can become the beast itself.",
