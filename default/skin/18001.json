  "description": "Despite the RPD's best efforts to curb Tristana's enthusiasm for vigilante justice, they haven't been successful. Then again, with a combination of determination, moxy, and explosives, she's more than capable of evading The Man. Whenever Tristana is \"off-duty,\" she can be found at a punk show or passing out the newest edition of her zine, \"Riot Riot!"
