  "description": "Shen is the last surviving founder of the Order of Solace. He shuttered every temple when the world fell into apathy and carelessness, disappearing into obscurity until Malzahar revived the Order. Now returned from the shadows, Shen serves as its most senior teacher, a stoic leader of integrity and grace that all can rely on."
