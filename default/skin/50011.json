  "description": "The hextech artificer known as Jericho Swain is an almost legendary figure among Piltover's growing upper crust. Though he professes not to meddle in city affairs, he has been quietly integrating various hextech components into his own bodyâ€¦ and with them, unparalleled access to the eyes and ears of thousands of artificial creatures."
