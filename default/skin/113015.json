  "description": "A merchant tycoon hailing from the top echelons of Piltovan society, Sejuani paved the way for the manufacture of hextech mounts. Often seen atop the back of her trusted stead, Bristech, she surveys the gilded streets of her magnificent city, always on the lookout to recruit young innovators who dare to push the boundaries of science and engineering.",
