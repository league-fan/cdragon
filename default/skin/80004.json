  "description": "A former Full Metal Robot Fighting League champion (2x reign, 14 title defenses), Pantheon was forced to retire in disgrace after a scandal involving Targon Fabrications. Reemerging from retirement to face the chosen champion, Jayce, Pantheon may be damaged, but has found that revenge adequately charges his weapon systems."
