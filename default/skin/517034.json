  "description": "Sylas deeply loved magic, but long years of imprisonment made him hateful. As a knight, he deigned to take as much power for himself as he could, and perhaps become a new wellspring of enchantmentâ€¦ yet, it was all for naught. Now only the dying shadow of magic remains, with he its final, bitter champion."
