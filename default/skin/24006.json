  "description": "Jax's search for inner peace brought him to many temples and the tutelage of various martial masters. His fiery attitude got him in trouble often, but Jax learned to appreciate the schooling. Tempering his battle prowess with a serene, strategic mind, Jax now faces every fight with a renewed unity of mind, body, and spirit.",
