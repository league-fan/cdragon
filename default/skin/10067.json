  "description": "When flames swept through Kayle's studio, at first she was overcome with grief. She had lost everything, but then realized that the fire freed her to do—and be—more. Now she returns to the Gala with her new line, Neon Flame, crossing styles, materials, and forms. Kayle has been reborn, and she will transcend everyone.",
