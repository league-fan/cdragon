  "description": "A warlock said to rule over the dead, who for reasons unknown fought to erase magic from the world. Perhaps Mordekaiser believed his powers would be spared, or perhaps the old knight planned to betray his fellows and reign over their darkened kingdoms. It matters little now, as he awaits the end of death itself.",
