  "description": "Hidden among the great flower-fields of the north are the Death Blossoms, primeval hunters whose disarming beauty would lull even the bravest knight to tears, if but for a moment. For Kha'Zix, feeding upon these hardy souls offers yet another chance at metamorphosisâ€¦ and a moment is all he needs."
