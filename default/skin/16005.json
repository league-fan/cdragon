  "description": "Origins of the Order of the Banana date back nearly a year, when the idea of throwing a banana as a weapon first occurred to Soraka. Her and her fellow banana-ites swore an oath to uphold the Order of the Banana, promising to fling the yellow produce at anyone who decided to worship a different fruit. Especially pomegranates.",
