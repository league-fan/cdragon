  "description": "Engrossed in his work to the point of near-obsession, Kassadin vanished for some time into the bowels of his labyrinthian workshop, disappearing from public life for years. When he emerged, he revealed a shocking hextech innovation to the world: his own body, fully integrated with the technology he so loved."
