  "description": "Twisted Fate was never supposed to be among the Order of the Musketeers, especially coming from a lowborn family. But his charm and quick wit—along with his skill in combat—helped him save the monarchy from a dastardly plot, earning him a place among the elite. Unfortunately for them, he prefers swashbuckling adventures to his actual duty."
