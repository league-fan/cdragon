  "description": "If one dares to gaze upon the crown, they'll immediately catch the careful eye of Fiora, the captain of the Royal Guard. Cunning, keen, and shrewd, she's written her own legend at the tip of her rapier, a legend so large that it's said, as a child, she could slice a falling leaf perfectly in half. Whether or not it's true... Fiora has never told.",
