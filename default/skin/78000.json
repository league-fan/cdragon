Bearing the legendary hammer of Orlon, a weapon twice her size, this determined yordle has spent untold years searching in secret for the fabled 'Hero of Demacia,' said to be its rightful wielder. Until then, she dutifully charges into battle, pushing back the kingdomâ€™s enemies with every whirling strike."
