  "description": "In an age before man, King Ornn ruled the craggy southlands, and he was as rocky and lifeless as they were. It is said that he weathered an endless siege from his brother, the great King Voli, and that the blood they spilled sprouted grass and trees and animals, even as they became like beasts themselves."
