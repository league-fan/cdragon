    "lore": "A massive creature of living stone, Malphite was born from the heart of the great Ixtali construct known as the Monolith. He has studied the elemental balance of Runeterra for centuries, using his tremendous strength to maintain order in a frequently chaotic world, and crush the dark things that crawl beneath it. Now, roused all too often from his slumbers, Malphite endures the fluid temperaments of mortals, in pursuit of the only cause worthy of the last of his kind."
