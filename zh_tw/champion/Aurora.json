Determined to learn more about the spirit realm's inhabitants, she left her home to further her research and happened upon a wayward demigod who'd become twisted and lost to time. Witnessing his desperation, Aurora resolved to find a way to help her feral friend regain his forgotten identity—a journey that would take her to the farthest reaches of the Freljord."
