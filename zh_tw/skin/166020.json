  "description": "當慰藉教團發現埃可尚時，他是個毫無靈魂的殺人機器，在他的導師被謀殺後陷入了復仇的無限循環。即使絕望如他，教團的教誨也能夠填滿埃可尚心中的無底洞，讓他重新找回自我。現在他做為三重榮譽的信徒與馬爾札哈一同作戰，準備好用和諧與俏皮話跟「本質」戰鬥。",

Even with his despair, the Order's teachings were able to fill the endless hole within Akshan and rejuvenate him. Now he stands with Malzahar as a Three Honors stalwart, ready to fight the Essents with harmony and quips."
