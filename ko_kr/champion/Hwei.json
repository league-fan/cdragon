Beneath his melancholy roils a torn, emotional mind—haunted by both the vibrant visions of his imagination and the gruesome memories of his temple's massacre. Hwei seeks to understand this light and dark, which drives him inevitably toward the artist who unraveled him. With paintbrush and palette, Hwei shapes endless possibilities as he draws ever closer to earning closure or embracing despair."

As herald, he used his brush to paint the Aurora across the skies, bringing the first snow. At Hecarim's beckoning, he waved his brush, parting the clouds to reveal a barren sky. Where was the Aurora?"
