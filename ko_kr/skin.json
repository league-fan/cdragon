Her natural affinity for fire manifested early in life through unpredictable, emotional outbursts, though she eventually learned to control these 'playful tricks.' Her favorite includes the summoning of her beloved teddy bear, Tibbers, as a fiery protector. Lost in the perpetual innocence of childhood, Annie wanders the dark forests, always looking for someone to play with."

Gathering up his family in his backpack, he set out to restore their singing voices and learn their songs as a new Rain Shepherd."

Beneath his melancholy roils a torn, emotional mind—haunted by both the vibrant visions of his imagination and the gruesome memories of his temple's massacre. Hwei seeks to understand this light and dark, which drives him inevitably toward the artist who unraveled him. With paintbrush and palette, Hwei shapes endless possibilities as he draws ever closer to earning closure or embracing despair."
